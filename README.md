# reactotron-react
### Universal [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron) import for [react-native](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/quick-start-react-native.md) and [react-js](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/quick-start-react-js.md)

If you are writing universal app for both web and native, and wonder whether to import `reactotron-react-native` or `reactotron-react-js`, import `reactotron-react` then.
Under the hood, `reactotron-react` uses module import and file extensions to selectively import `reactotron-react-native` or `reactotron-react-js` based on the platform you are running on.
